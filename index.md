WORK EXPERIENCE · FINANCE 👨‍💼
============================

UI Architect · Neo FX · UBS
---------------------------

> *Oct 22 - present*

**Current objective**: work with the team to produce a SWOT analysis of the various JS apps and define strategy, target state.

*Highlights so far:*

* [Modernisation] converted one repo to `TypeScript` and achieved 98% "type coverage" in a month; changes are safer and DX better
* [Design] currently writing a general-purpose WS STOMP `redux-saga` messaging abstraction for request-response + subscriptions

Full Stack, Lead, Manager · Execute · J.P. Morgan
-------------------------------------------------

> *Feb 12 - Oct 22*

Delivered many different client-facing apps as part of FX Cash, FX Orders and Rates teams

*Highlights:*

* [Server IPC] Used `Spring WebFlux`, `Reactor` and `server-sent-events` to create a server-to-server streaming API and client
* [Design] Created a next-gen batteries-included **order-state-management library** (`xstate` and `RxJS`) on top of which we rapidly built mew Rates Order tickets and a primary Rates Auction product. **React components are extremely lightweight, all logic in lower layer**
* [Design] Designed and implemented FX Order import (from spreadsheet) using state-machines, for declarative, deterministic behaviour. In production for >1 year, heavily used, and **not a single production issue**!
* [Advocacy] Gave internal info-shares to promote use of state machines (vs Redux)
* [Quality] Created a suite of **end-to-end tests** in `jest`, `JSDOM` and `gherkin`
* [Performance] Converted many `AG Grid` React cell renderers to plain TS for **max performance**. Created AG Grid React tooltip bridge, allowing **rich React tooltips for AG Grid cells**, powered by `popper.js`
* [Performance] Built `RxJS` pipeline for AG Grid row-, column-visibility and sort-state, to drive price-subscriptions for "Pips to Market" column
* [Productivity] Automated continuous manual upgrades, **saving hours of developer time per week, across multiple projects**

Flex Developer · Rates SDP · HSBC
---------------------------------

> *May 11 - Feb 12*

* [Performance] **Improved free-text-search indexing time by 10X** using `Trie` data structure and **removing temporary string allocations**
* [Usability] Implemented "iOS Contacts" style counterparty search with sticky headers on scroll and ability to **effortlessly scroll >100K records with just-in-time data fetching**

Lead, Java, JavaScript and Flex Developer · Deutsche Bank
---------------------------------------------------------

> *Aug 07 - May 11*

* [Performance] **Optimised Oracle SQL queries**
* [Productivity] Various dev-tool improvements for **massive productivity gains**, eg, converted ad-hoc server build scripts to `Ant` and `Ivy` (simpler, smaller and faster than `Maven`); made it possible to run server in IDE; compile Flex GUI code on-demand in Java servlet, for **edit, refresh, test** workflow
